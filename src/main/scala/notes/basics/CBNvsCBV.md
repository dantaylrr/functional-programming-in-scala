# Call-by-Name vs Call-by-Value.

* Call by Value follows a typical function call where the evaluated value is passed into the function.
* The value is then used everywhere.
* Call by Name passes the evaluation into the function itself & evaluates it at each instance of which it occurs in the function.
* This results in different values at each point inside the function.
