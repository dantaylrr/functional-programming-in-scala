# Type Inference with the Compiler.

What does the compiler know?

* The compiler will figure out value types for us if we do not explicitely specify it.
* The compiler can also figure out the return types of functions by evaluating the implementation.
* However, you shouldn't try to fool it - it's good practice to state the return type.
