# Case Classes.

* Quick, lightweight data structures with little boilerplate code.
* Companions already implemented with apply methods.
* Sensible equals, hashCode & toString methods already implemented.
* Auto-promotion of params/constructor inputs to fields.
* Cloning.
* Case classes are serializable & allow for pattern matching.
* ```case object```'s are also powerful.
