# Objects.

* Scala does not have "static" values or methods for class level functionality.
* Scala instead has Scala objects.
  * These are their own class.
  * They are also the only instance of the object.
  * These allow for the singleton instance / pattern in one line of code.
* Scala has companions:
  * Can access each other's private members.
  * Scala is more object-orientated than most other languages!
* Scala applications:
  * Either define the ```main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {}``` method.
  * Or define ```extends App``` functionality.
