# Key Takeaways.

* Scala offers class-based inheritance with the ```extends``` key-word.
  * Access modifiers - ```private```, ```protected``` etc.
  * The default access modifier is public.
  * Need to pass in constructor arguments to the parent class.
* Derived classes can override members or methods.
* We can re-use parent fields or methods with ```super```.
* We can prevent inheritance & overrides with ```final``` & ```sealed```.
* We can define ```abstract``` classes.
* We can extend class behaviours using ```trait```'s.
* We can inherit from a class with multiple traits using the ```with``` key-word.
