# Expressions.

* If in Scala is an expression - it always evaluates to something.
* Code Blocks in Scala are also expressions - the value of the code block is the value of it's last evaluated expression.
* Instructions are executed (do this thing) & follow an imperative design (such as in Python or Java), expressions are always evaluated (give me the value of this) & follow a functional design (Scala).
* Do not use WHILE loops in Scala.
